# This is a basic React Native "Guess a Number" Application.

## It has 3 screens primarily and the code has been written in a very modular and re-useable way.

### Please note that the functionality is pretty basic and so is the styling.


It has the following features:

1) One can add a number between 1 and 100 for the computer to guess.
2) The computer will then try to guess the number.
3) The user can give hints to the computer.
4) Extensive validations have been added so that the user can't fool the computer.
5) When the computer guesses the correct number, the number chosen, the number of guesses it took to get there are displayed in a new screen.
